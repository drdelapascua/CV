# Research

*PhD Student, Gremer Laboratory, University of California, Davis* \hfill 2017-present

> Studying plant responses to climate change using a combination of field, genomics, and modeling approaches. Specifically, investigating the effects of snowmelt timing on phenology and gene flow in several populations of the native California plant *Streptanthus tortuosus* at Lassen Volcanic National Park.

*Research Assistant, Schmitt Laboratory, University of California, Davis* \hfill 2016-2017

> Studied life history variation and local adaptation in the plant *Streptanthus tortuosus* across elevational and latitudinal clines in the context of its ability to adapt to climate change.


*Research Assistant, Winfree Laboratory, Rutgers University* \hfill 2015

> Conducted field work determining the effectiveness of pollinator habitat restoration strategies on native bees. Identified New Jersey bees and plants to species and curated insect and plant collections. Measured bee and floral traits to quantify trait matching.


*Research Assistant, Bertness Laboratory, Brown University* \hfill 2013-2015

> Performed field experiments in Cape Cod salt marshes demonstrating that recreational overfishing triggers a trophic cascade that leads to salt marsh die-off.

*Research Assistant, Wessel Laboratory, Brown University* \hfill 2013

> Studied expression of meiotic genes and proteins during echinoderm embryogenesis and gametogenesis. Designed and performed independent study researching possible splicing event in echinoderm meiotic gene dmc1.
